# simple-secure-mvc

This project contains my take on a MVC based application written in PHP, it has a simple SQLite database, but it can be improved to any database your desire.

It really is a kickstarter to a new project, it contains the architecture for implementing the design pattern MVC and it already has some builtin functions to prevent SQL injection, XSS and CSRF.

The application is divided in four main categories:
  - Models: interaction with database
  - Views: interaction with user
  - Controllers: interaction between models and views
  - Libraries: utility classes
  
It has a simple configuration file to define some constant variables that are usefull throughout the app.

Hope you enjoy it, you can email me if you have any doubts to joaomlap@gmail.com.
